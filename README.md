# -Build-a-Calculator-CLI-App

This project is a Command-Line Calculator App built using Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — through a simple text-based interface. The program uses functions for each operation and handles user input in a loop, allowing multiple calculations until the user chooses to exit. It also includes basic error handling, such as preventing division by zero.

The goal of this task is to demonstrate the use of:

1.Functions

2.Loops

3.Conditionals

4.CLI interaction using input() and print()

==>What This Project Does
This Command-Line Calculator App allows users to perform basic mathematical operations directly from the terminal. It supports:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division (with error handling for division by zero)

The user interacts with the program via the terminal/command line. They can choose an operation from a menu, input two numbers, and receive the result. The program runs in a loop, letting users perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit.
