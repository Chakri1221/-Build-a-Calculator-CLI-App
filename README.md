# -Build-a-Calculator-CLI-App

This project is a Command-Line Calculator App built using Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — through a simple text-based interface. The program uses functions for each operation and handles user input in a loop, allowing multiple calculations until the user chooses to exit. It also includes basic error handling, such as preventing division by zero.

The goal of this task is to demonstrate the use of:

1.Functions

2.Loops

3.Conditionals

4.CLI interaction using input() and print()
